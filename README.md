Field-navigation prototype: tactical-style map with live MGRS, GeoPDF/calibrated-PDF
basemaps, drawing overlays exportable as GeoJSON, and fiduciary calibration for
any PDF that lacks proper georeferencing. iOS (SwiftUI + MapKit) and Android
(Kotlin + Compose + Google Maps) ship from one repository.

## What it does today

### Live navigation HUD

- **Live MGRS** in a tactical-green monospace at the top, spaced as
  `56HLH 13225 37516`. Header flips between **Your Location** (GPS fix) and
  **Map Centre** (when you pan away) automatically.
- **WGS84 lat/lon** + **elevation** (metres above sea level) live at the
  crosshair, fetched from Open-Meteo's Copernicus DEM (≈30 m global resolution)
  on a 400 ms debounce so we don't hammer the network during a pan.
- **NATO mils compass** (6400 per circle). The N marker rotates with the map
  so it always points to true north; the 4-digit mils readout in the lower
  half stays static. Tap to snap back to north-up.
- **Centre-pivot rotation** — the default `MKMapView` rotation drags the
  centre around with your fingers. Ours overrides it so the map spins in
  place around the screen centre.

### Drawing & waypoints

- Drop **waypoints** with kind (camp, water, observation point, drop zone,
  hazard) and elevation.
- Draw **polylines, polygons, and points** — tap successive points on the
  map, undo last vertex, finish to commit. In-progress shapes render dashed.
- **Export everything as GeoJSON** following the [Mapbox simplestyle-spec]
  (stroke / stroke-width / fill / fill-opacity / marker-color / marker-symbol
  with [Maki icon] names). Opens directly in **geojson.io, GitHub gists,
  Mapbox, Felt, Leaflet, QGIS, ArcGIS, Google Earth**.

### GeoPDF basemap

- Import any **GeoPDF** via the Files app. The PDF replaces the satellite
  basemap and stays anchored to its true geographic bounds when you pan / zoom
  / rotate.
- **LGIDict parser** handles the OGC GeoPDF format used by ADF, AUSLIG, USGS,
  and most government topo PDFs:
  - Multi-entry LGIDicts (picks the one with `/Description (Layers)`)
  - PDF-string-encoded reals (e.g. `(135.83)` instead of `135.83`)
  - Projections: **LL** (geographic), **UT** (UTM), **TC** (Transverse
    Mercator routed through UTM when the central meridian matches a zone)
- **Adobe Geospatial fallback** for newer PDFs that use `/VP/Measure` +
  `/GPTS` instead of LGIDict.
- **Fiduciary calibration UI** for any PDF without proper metadata — tap
  3+ known features on the PDF, enter their MGRS, and `AffineFitter` solves
  a least-squares affine to re-derive bounds. Shows RMS residual in metres
  so you know how trustworthy the fit is.

### Search

- **Place name / address** via `MKLocalSearch`, biased toward the current
  camera area.
- **Full MGRS** — type `56HLH 13225 37516`, jump straight there.
- **Partial grid** — type just **4 / 6 / 8 / 10 figures** (e.g. `1885`) and
  we resolve against your current GZD + 100km square prefix, then drop
  you at the centre of the implied square (1 km / 100 m / 10 m / 1 m
  precision respectively).
- Crash-safe: regex pre-validates MGRS shape before calling NGA's parser
  (which used to `fatalError` on partial input).

## iOS — build & run

```bash
# 1. Tools (one-off)
brew install xcodegen
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch

# 2. Generate the Xcode project
cd ios
xcodegen generate

# 3. Open
open TacticalMaps.xcodeproj
```

First build resolves Swift packages (mgrs is vendored, but pure-Swift deps
still download). Pick an iPhone simulator and press ▶.

**Generate the App Store icon** (if you tweak the design in
`scripts/generate_icon.swift`):

```bash
swift scripts/generate_icon.swift
```

---

## Android — build & run

```bash
# 1. Tools (one-off)
brew install --cask android-studio android-commandlinetools
open -a "Android Studio"   # Run the first-launch SDK wizard + create an AVD

# 2. Get a Google Maps API key (free)
#    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key
#    Add it to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (kept out of the repo):
#       MAPS_API_KEY=AIza…

# 3. Open in Studio
open -a "Android Studio" android
```

Without an API key the map will render as a grey grid + watermark, but every
other UI element still works.

## Architecture overview

The single most important architectural choice: **all overlays (waypoints,
drawings, fiduciaries) are stored in WGS84**. MGRS is presentation-only,
computed on the fly via NGA's `mgrs-ios`. This means swapping basemaps
(satellite ↔ GeoPDF ↔ calibrated PDF) never requires re-projecting overlays.

Full design + math in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Roadmap

- **Wave 2 projections** — Lambert Conformal Conic (French IGN, Canadian
  NRCan, US state plane), arbitrary-central-meridian TM (UK OSGB36, NZ NZTM),
  non-WGS84 datum shifts.
- **Persistent fiduciaries per PDF** — currently in-memory only; needs a
  `Calibration/CalibrationStore.swift`.
- **Route logging** — the iOS `UIBackgroundModes: [location]` declaration is
  in place; logger UI + GPX export TBD.
- **iCloud sync** for waypoints + drawings.
- **Android feature parity** — the Android edition builds + runs but only the
  basic HUD is wired; drawing / search / GeoPDF still iOS-only.

---

## App Store status

The iOS build is App-Store-ready in terms of assets:

- 1024×1024 icon, launch screen, acknowledgements view all in place
- Privacy policy at [`docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
- Step-by-step submission checklist at
  [`docs/APPSTORE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/APPSTORE_CHECKLIST.md)

It has not been submitted yet — if you do, see the checklist for the
Apple-side steps (Developer Program enrolment, name reservation, screenshots,
TestFlight).

---

## Privacy

We collect **nothing**. No accounts, no telemetry, no third-party SDKs, no
advertising IDs. Only outbound HTTPS calls are to Apple's Maps service (basemap
tiles + search) and Open-Meteo (elevation). Full disclosure in
[`docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Includes vendored NGA `mgrs-ios` (MIT)
with a small Snyder UTM patch for Xcode 26 compatibility.
